# Pathfinding Sandbox

This project contains a demo to test benchmarks of some A\* search algorithms in Unity. 

[You can try it in a browser](http://m039.github.io/PathfindingSandbox), but it gives inaccurate results. It is better to use a desktop build.

Algorithms used:
* [Pathfinding from Common Unity Library](https://github.com/m039/CommonUnityLibrary/tree/16189a32a353a77fd8ca36687641e57c09dbaf89/Runtime/Scripts/AI/Pathfinding)
* [A\* Pathfinding Project](https://arongranberg.com/astar/)
* [Pathfinding by RonenNess](https://github.com/RonenNess/Unity-2d-pathfinding)
